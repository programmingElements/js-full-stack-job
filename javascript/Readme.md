       - JavaScript was invented in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. It was initially developed in just ten days and was originally called Mocha, later renamed to LiveScript, and finally JavaScript. The language was created to make web pages more interactive and dynamic.
       
       - it is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions.
