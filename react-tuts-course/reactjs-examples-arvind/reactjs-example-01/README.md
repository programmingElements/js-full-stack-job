1. JavaScript Modules

2. React Elements & DOM Elements

3. Setting up a Fresh React Project using npm

4. Webpack, CSS Loaders

   npx => node package execute
   cmd: npx webpack

5. JSX & Babel Compiler


6. Real DOM : It is also called as Document Object Model / Real DOM

   React Uses 2 Algorithms 
   -----------------------    
         - Reconcilation Algorithm => virtual DOM updates to Real DOM Reconcilation Algorithm Works.
         - Diffing Algorithm => Compare Old VDOM to New VDOM If Differences are available that different elements only renders into the Real DOM => O(n) time complexity.
